# KNIME Workflows for Machine Learning - Training Examples

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of KNIME workflows that I developed during my L4 Machine Learning training. These examples reflect the theoretical knowledge I've gained and how I've applied it practically using KNIME.

The purpose of this repository is to:

1. **Share Learning:** Provide examples of basic machine learning workflows that may be useful for others starting out with KNIME.
2. **Showcase Learning Progress:** Highlight the skills I have developed during my training, including data manipulation and basic machine learning tasks.
3. **Professional Portfolio:** Serve as a portfolio for recruiters, such as those from Virtusa, to view the work I have done as part of my learning journey.

## Contents

The repository is organized into folders, each representing a different workflow or project. The workflows cover various introductory topics in machine learning, such as classification and data preprocessing. Included in each folder are:

- **Data Files:** Example datasets used in the workflows.
- **Documentation:** Brief descriptions of each workflow, including the main objective and key steps.
- **Screenshots:** Visuals showing the workflow setup and results.

## About Me

I'm diving into data science world, with a strong focus on web scraping and data extraction. I'm gaining solid experience in overcoming complex anti-bot measures like Cloudflare, Datadome, and CAPTCHA systems. While I'm just getting started with data science, my expertise in scraping is already strong, and I'm committed to applying these skills effectively.
