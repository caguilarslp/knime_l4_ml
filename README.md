# KNIME Workflows for Machine Learning - Training Examples

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of KNIME workflows that I developed during my L4 Machine Learning training. These examples reflect the theoretical knowledge I've gained and how I've applied it practically using KNIME.

The purpose of this repository is to:

1. **Share Learning:** Provide examples of basic machine learning workflows that may be useful for others starting out with KNIME.
2. **Showcase Learning Progress:** Highlight the skills I have developed during my training, including data manipulation and basic machine learning tasks.
3. **Professional Portfolio:** Serve as a portfolio for recruiters, such as those from Virtusa, to view the work I have done as part of my learning journey.

## Contents

The repository is organized into folders, each representing a different workflow or project. The workflows cover various introductory topics in machine learning, such as classification and data preprocessing. Included in each folder are:

- **Data Files:** Example datasets used in the workflows.
- **Documentation:** Brief descriptions of each workflow, including the main objective and key steps.
- **Screenshots:** Visuals showing the workflow setup and results.

## About Me

I am currently focused on developing my skills in data science and machine learning, particularly through the use of KNIME. My background includes theoretical training in machine learning, and I am eager to continue building on this foundation.
